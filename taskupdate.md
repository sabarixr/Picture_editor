# Task update

- Filter part complete.
- File upload part complete.
- FIle save part complete
- I did made a gallery view but there was some error when we added a new image so i didnt include it.


Overall I liked working with react the previos task help me a lot in this only stugguled a little bit at the saving part. The biggest issue  was the time.
Due to the end of sem there was a lot of assigments viva test back to back so i wasnt able to complete the task fully. Makeing predefined filters can be done by makeing a state with the css filters of diffrent kind.

Thank You.
